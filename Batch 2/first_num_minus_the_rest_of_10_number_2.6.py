# pseudocode
# initialize constants 
    # first_number
    # the_rest_of_the_numbers

# ask user for inputs of the 10 numbers
    # user for loop for the 9 other numbers
    # add the numbers to the initialized constant
    # separated from the first number

# minus the first number to the iniatilized constant
# print the results
